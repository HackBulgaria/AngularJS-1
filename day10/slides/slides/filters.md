# Filters

* Name your filters with lowerCamelCase.
* Make your filters as light as possible. They are called often during the `$digest` loop so creating a slow filter will slow down your app.
* Do a single thing in your filters, keep them coherent. More complex manipulations can be achieved by piping existing filters.
