* When creating directives it may be useful to put all the files associated with the given directive files (i.e. templates, CSS/SASS files, JavaScript) in a single folder. If you choose to use this style be consistent and use it everywhere along your project.

```
app
└── directives
    ├── directive1
    │   ├── directive1.html
    │   ├── directive1.js
    │   └── directive1.sass
    └── directive2
        ├── directive2.html
        ├── directive2.js
        └── directive2.sass
```
This approach can be combined with both directory structures above.
