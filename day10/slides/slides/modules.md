## Modules

* Modules should be named with lowerCamelCase. For indicating that module `b` is submodule of module `a` you can nest them by using namespacing like: `a.b`.

There are two common ways for structuring the modules:

0. By functionality
0. By component type

Currently there's not a big difference, but the first way looks cleaner. Also, if lazy-loading modules is implemented (currently not in the AngularJS roadmap), it will improve the app's performance.
