* DOM manipulations must be done only through directives.
* Create an isolated scope when you develop reusable components.
* Use directives as attributes or elements instead of comments or classes, this will make your code more readable.
* Use `$scope.$on('$destroy', fn)` for cleaning up. This is especially useful when you're wrapping third-party plugins as directives.
* Do not forget to use `$sce` when you should deal with untrusted content.
