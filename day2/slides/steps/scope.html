<h2>Scope</h2>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
In AngularJS scope is JavaScript object, which is exposed to the partials. The scope could contains different properties - primitives, objects or methods. All methods attached to the scope could be invoked by evaluation of AngularJS expression inside the partials associated with the given scope or direct call of the method by any component, which keeps reference to the scope.
