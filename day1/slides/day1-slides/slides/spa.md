## Single-Page Applications

SPA is web application, which once loaded, does not require full page reload when the user performs any actions with it. This means that all application resources (data, templates, scripts, styles) should be loaded with the initial request or better - the information and resources should be loaded on demand.

### Horizontal

The horizontal SPA have a lot of views and complex page relations. They are not with that complex UI but a lot of data exchange and/or many views.

### Vertical

The vertical SPA have only a few views with a lot of components in them. They usually have very complex state but don't require loading of a lot of data on demand.
